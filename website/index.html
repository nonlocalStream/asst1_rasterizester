<h1 align="middle">Assignment 1: Rasterizester</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Chuqian Li(Rita)</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p> This assignment is mainly about rasterization, anti-aliasing and diffrent texture mapping schemes. The first two parts are about rasterizing lines and triangles. Part 3 investigates anti-aliasing with supersampling. Part 4 and 5 are about transformations and barycentric coordinates. Part 6 and 7 investigate texture mapping by using different sampling scheme and mipmap.
<!--         <p>Use this section to write an overview of the assignment. All of the text in your write-up should be <em>in your own words</em>. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> website for instructions. To edit the HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.</p>
        <o>The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both rendered images as well as written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!</p> 
        <p>If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking page. Just make sure that you include all the components as we've laid them out here. </p>
        <p>For required images, keep the image size fixed at the native width of the file to avoid artifacts. You might want to adjust your rasterizester window size down to be less than 1000 pixels wide if you are working on a retina display screen, since  -->the 1920 by 1280 images will be enormous on normal monitors.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing Lines</h2>
        <p> In this part, I use Bresenham's algorithm to rasterize line (x0,y0)-(x1,y1). The basic idea is to start at (floor(x0), floor(y0)), increase x by 1 each time. I have an error variable that increases by dy/dx each time each time the x increases. When the error variable is bigger than 0.5, y is increased by 1.
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">error + dy/dx < 0.5</pre></p>
        <p>Because divison by floating points is prone to errors. We multiply both sides by dx and get:
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">error*dx + dy < 0.5*dx</pre></p>
        <p>However this only works when x1-x0 = dx > 0, y1-y0 = dy > 0, and dx >= dy. So I got:


        <div align="left">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/p1_1.png" width="800px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Figure 1.1: Basic algorithm only works in octant</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>So I used a generalized version of Bresenham's algorithm. Instead of moving increasing x and y. Increase x and y by sign(x) and sign(y) where sign(i) = 1 if i >=0, -1 if i < 0. Also instead of increasing x each time, increase x only if dx >= dy and increase y when dy > dx. Also when dy > dx, multiply both sides of inequality by dy instead dx. With this modifications, I got: </p>
        <div align="left">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/p1_2.png" width="800px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Figure 1.1: Basic algorithm only works in octant</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h2>
        <p>In this part, I'm rasterizing triangle given its 3 vertices (x0,y0),(x1,y1),(x2,y2).</p>
        <p>The basic idea is to split the triangle into 2 triangles and rasterize row by row. For each row, calculate the two ends of the row using the following formula, where (x0,y0)-(x1,y1) is one side of triangle, y is the current row's y coordinate and (x,y) is the intersection: </p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">(y0-y)*(x1-x) = (y1-y)*(x0-x)</pre></p>
        <p> Say the two ends of the row is x_left and x_right. Either use rasterize_line in part 1 or rasterize the row by filling each pixel between x_left and x_right.</p>
        <p> For some reason, using rasterize_line in part 1 gives me white cracks. This could be caused by the edge cases of triangle's edges or floating point operations. Filling each pixel between the two ends avoid white cracks. Compare:</p>

        <div align="left">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/p2_1.png" width="533px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Figure 2.1: Fill rows with rasterize_line in part 1</figcaption>

                    <td align="middle">

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p> So I stick to filling each pixels and get:</p>
        <div align="left">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Antialiasing triangles</h2>
        <p>Looking at Figure 2.3, you can see that the sides of the triangle become jittered and the skinny triangles become discontinuous. In order to mitigate those sampling artifects, aka antialiasing, I used grid supersampling. The easiest way to do this is to multiply the coordinates by sqrt(sample_rate) and rasterize it in a super sampling buffer, basically an enlarged image. Compress the super sampling buffer by taking averages of the corresponding pixels and copy the final image into the frame buffer.</p>
        <p>To averaging over sample_rate pixels, use weighted average with alpha as weight ((R,G,B,A) is the averaged pixel and (r_i, g_i, b_i, a_i) are super samples):</p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle"> R = sum(r_i * a_i)</pre></p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle"> G = sum(g_i * a_i)</pre></p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle"> B = sum(b_i * a_i)</pre></p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle"> A = sum(a_i)/sample_rate</pre></p>
        <p>New struct defined: samplebuffer - Store the enlarged super sample image</p>
        <p>New functions defined: 
        <p>sample_point - Instead of writing to framebuffer, write super samples to samplebuffer
        <p>resolve - Average the supersamples and write to framebuffer
        </p>
        <div align="left">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

        <p> One mistake I made was that when I tried to access pixel (sx, sy) in the samplebuffer, I forgot to use the new width, width*sqrt(sample_rate). So I got multiple objects when increasing sample_rate, which is actually kind of cool. </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 6: Pixel sampling for texture mapping</h2>
        <p> Use barycentric coordinates to calculate the texel (u,v) on texture space that corresponds to each pixel (x,y) on screen space.
        <p> u and v is originally calculated as float numbers. Nearest pixel sampling choose the texel that's nearest to u and v. Bilinear pixel interpolation sampling linearly interpolate between (floor(u), floor(v)), (floor(u), ceil(v)),(ceil(u), floor(v)),(ceil(u), ceil(v)) using:</p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">
        <img src="images/p7_1.png"/ width=500px>
        </pre></p>
        <p>In case of texture magnification, a texture image is enlarged on the screen space. The texture image doesn't have enough texels to render a high-resolution screen image. In this case, bilinear pixel interpolation calculate the intermediate color between two texels and thus render a much smoother image than nearest pixel.</p>
        <p>In case of texture minification, the texture image is large enough or has enough resolution. So the two sampling method don't differ much.</p>
        <p>Supersampling also average over multiple samples and thus has similar effects to bilinear interpolation. Thus at high sample_rate, the difference is also much smallar. Compare: </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 7: Level sampling with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
        <p>Describe what you did in Part 7. Pull some png images from the internet and create your own svg files to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of various techniques at different zoom levels. You can take existing files in svg/texmap/ and replace the texture filename to try out new images. Show at least one example (using a png file you find yourself) comparing all four combinations of one of L_ZERO and L_NEAREST with one of P_NEAREST and P_BILINEAR at a zoomed out viewpoint. If you implement any extra filtering methods, describe them and show comparisons.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 8: My drawing</h2>
        <p>Describe your original drawing and include a picture of it. This part is extremely open ended, and if you decide to devote a lot of time to making an awesome picture, it's worth explaining how you did it!</p>

<!--     <h2 align="middle">A Few Notes On Webpages</h2>
        <p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. You will probably encounter these problems at some point, so don't wait until right before the deadline to check that everything is working. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
        <li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
        <li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
        Do <em>NOT</em> use absolulte paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
        <li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre>
        <li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>
        <li>And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!</li>
